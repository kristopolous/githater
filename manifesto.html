<h1>IHATE MANIFESTO</h1>

<h3>Unix is hard, let's start talking.</h3>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>I started a githater twitter account 2 years ago out of my frustration with my inability to get the hang of the powerful syntax.</p>

<p>git doesn't stand alone here. I can never remember how to </p>

<ul>
<li>modify my firewall rules</li>
<li>do anything with gpg</li>
<li>do a POST in curl</li>
<li>anything more than the most basic sed</li>
<li>use getopt or readline</li>
<li>use find to say, find new files in the past day</li>
<li>dates, anywhere; sql, the shell, php</li>
<li>just about anything with mdadm</li>
<li>cut, copy, paste; from the command line. I'm sure it's awesome.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not alone here. But what are we going to do about it?</p>

<h2>IHATE</h2>

<p>Imagine a tool called ihate. Here is an example:</p>

<div style="background:#ccc;padding:0.5em;margin:1em">
$ ihate git how do i clone things quickly
<div style="margin-left:1.25em">
Only clone what's necessary to get going instead of everything
<br />
 git clone --depth=1
 </div>
</div>
<p>The syntax is:</p>

<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;ihate (program) (description of what you want to do)</code></p>

<p>And then, like magic, you will get a human readable solution to get
things done.</p>

<h2>THE MAGIC</h2>

<p>IHATE.PY makes RESTful calls to a community driven website.</p>

<p>On the website a very generous person has provided the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>name of program</li>
<li>1 and 2-grams along with a weight for the matching of the sentences</li>
<li>a twitter-like description of the task</li>
<li>an actual command line</li>
<li>a disclaimer and a rank as to how "safe" a command is. As in "Warning: This command reformats your hard drive. Risk: 5/5 Highest"</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it. It's going to be awesome!</p>
